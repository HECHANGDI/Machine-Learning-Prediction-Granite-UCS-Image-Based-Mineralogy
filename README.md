# Machine-Learning-for-Predicting-the-UCS-of-Granite-from-Image-Derived-Mineralogical-Features
This study uses machine learning (ML) models to predict the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of granite directly from digital images. An in-house Digital Image Processing tool was used to estimate mineralogical features, including mineral content, distribution, and grain size, from granite digital images, as input variables for the ML models.
